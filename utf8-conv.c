/* An explanation about Unicode and Han orthography:

   The Han region starts at 0x3400, and ends at 0x2FA1D. This means two
	 possible conversions between Unicode and UTF-8: the low end becomes
	 a three-octet UTF-8 sequence, but the high end takes on four octets.
	 The number of leading 1's in the first octet indicates the total number
	 of octets in the UTF-8 sequence. That is, a three-octet sequence starts
	 with a 1110xxxx, while a four-octet sequence starts with 11110xxx. Each
	 subsequent octet takes the form 10xxxxxx.
	 
	 "man utf-8" has a fantastic explanation of how Unicode and UTF-8 map
	 onto each other. Note that this code does *not* enforce the "shortest
	 valid form" rule of UTF-8.
